# Really Simple Timer

Daily stand-up meetings... Every day, a 15-minutes meeting is scheduled to let every team member explained what he/she has done yesterday, and what he/she will do today.

Nice!

... but... 15 minutes for 7 people mean not more than 2 minutes by speaker (considering it start on time)

## Goal of this "application

This is because we _never_ respected the 15 minutes timeslot this timer could help: it will display a very basic timer, to be share with co-workers during the daily, to let them know how much time it remains.

## How to use?

This is a static website: you just need to open the `index.html` in a web browser.

## How to set time?

In your web browser URL just add a query string `duration`!

For instance:

| Duration   | URL                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------- |
| 4 minutes  | `index.html?duration=4:00`  |
| 2 minutes  | `index.html?duration=2:00`  |
| 45 minutes | `index.html?duration=45:00` |
| 4 minutes  | `index.html?duration=4:00`  |


That's it! :smile:


## What else?

For the moment, nothing!

Some other features may come... but the goal is really to keep this as simple/basic as possible!
